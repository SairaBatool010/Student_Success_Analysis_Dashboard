Student Success Analysis

Business Problem:

To enhance academic results and retention rates, the aim is to fully understand the influence of various financial factors on student success. The goal is to identify which financial indicators (e.g., scholarship status, debt levels, parental income, and employment status) and macroeconomic conditions (e.g., GDP, unemployment rates) most significantly correlate with academic performance metrics such as grades, course completion rates, and dropout rates.

Data Cleaning/Wrangling:

We tested the data for missing values. These were the values missing:

Missing values:

Age at enrollment (2)

Course Name (2)

Daytime/Evening Attendance (3)

Nationality Name (11)

For the last three, we fixed them through mapping. For "Age at Enrollment," we computed the mean and inserted it.

Recommendations and Insights:

Course and Demographic Factors:

Marital Status: Significant differences in course distribution suggest marital status influences course enrollment choices.

Mother's Occupation: Variations in course enrollment highlight a socio-economic dimension in course selection.

Gender: Strong gender-based differences in course selection suggest societal norms or career aspirations play a role.

Curricular Performance and Attendance Type:

Daytime/Evening Attendance: Attendance type affects student performance significantly.

Displaced Students: Displacement status correlates with performance, indicating challenges or advantages linked to mobility.

Socio-Economic Factors and Academic Outcomes:

Educational Special Needs: Tailored support is required as these students show different academic outcomes.

Debtor Status: Financial stress may contribute to varying academic performances.

Economic Indicators and Student Characteristics:

Scholarship Holder Status: Macroeconomic conditions influence the likelihood of receiving scholarships.

Displacement and Economic Factors: Economic conditions like unemployment and GDP strongly impact student mobility.

Admission and Previous Academic Performance:

International Students: These students display distinct academic profiles compared to domestic students.

Marital Status: Married students may have different academic backgrounds and outcomes.

Application Mode and Student Attributes:

Application Mode: The mode of application is associated with distinct academic characteristics.

Gender Differences: Substantial gender-based differences in academic performance metrics are evident.

Parental Influence on Academic Outcomes:

Mother's and Father's Qualifications: Parental education significantly impacts student success.
